// The one piece of the harness that travels in git.
//
// `project-manifest` settled what gets committed: the manifest (what the team decided) travels, the
// wiring travels, and `.rsc/` does not — its contents are machine-shaped, symlinks on one OS and
// real copies on another, and committing either shape breaks the other. That boundary is right and
// this file does not move it.
//
// What it left behind is the hole this file fills: the committed wiring points into the directory
// that does not travel, so the first session in a clone runs seven hooks against seven files that
// are not there. The person does not get a warning, they get the module loader's stack trace — and
// three of the seven are shell guards, so they get it again on every shell call. `project-manifest`
// already promised the opposite ("quien clona se entera de que tiene que reconstruir sin que nadie
// se lo diga"); this is the promise being kept.
//
// So the wiring points HERE instead, and this file is committed. Two jobs, in this order:
//
//   1. The harness is mounted  → delegate to the real script and say NOTHING of our own. The healthy
//      case is almost everyone, every session, and it must cost zero bytes of context (P5 — this
//      repo's own scar is 207 KB paid per turn). One existsSync is not paid in tokens; a line of
//      output is.
//   2. The harness is not mounted → say what is wrong as a symptom, name what would be installed,
//      and get out of the way. Never block the turn, never write anything first.
//
// It never throws. A bootstrap that can crash is the bug it exists to remove.
